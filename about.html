        The code below is dedicated to importing the
        website logo and the css stylesheet used to make
        the website look good.

        If you remove the icon it'll be fine although
        if you remove the stylesheet the whole website
        will look like a mess and will be barely usable.

        easier to use layout on your mobile device, like a phone,
